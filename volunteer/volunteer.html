                    A clinical trial is designed by a sponsor. A sponsor is typically a pharmaceutical company with a new product or an existing product that they would like to test. The sponsor contracts with a principal investigator who is a doctor that actually runs the clinical trial. An investigator will have help from various people, including a study manager that manages the trial and clinicians who are medical personnel that perform the study procedures.</p>

                    Subjects are people who volunteer to undergo the procedures in the trial. The rights of the subjects are protected by an independent review board (IRB). The IRB makes sure the clinical trial and the physician investigator are acting ethically and that the subjects are properly protected.</p>

For studies conducted in the UK, the guidelines are set down by the UK Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). In addition, each study is reviewed by an Independent Ethics Committee who are responsible for ensuring that your safety has been thoroughly considered, that the information provided to you is fair, balanced and accurate and that your rights as a volunteer are maintained. </p>

                <p class="mt-3" data-zanim-xs='{"delay":0.1}'> Each clinical study is described by a document called a protocol. Protocols describe what type of subjects can and can't be enrolled into the study. The protocol also includes information like the study schedule, a list of the procedures to perform, and any laboratory tests to be run. Each protocol is different. Before you enter a trial, the principal investigator will describe to you the procedures, risks and benefits during the informed consent process.

                <p class="mt-3" data-zanim-xs='{"delay":0.1}'>  Even though every trial is different, most trials require you to have some blood and urine samples taken, your blood pressure and pulse monitored and ECG recordings. Depending on the trial, sometimes the meals you are provided with will be determined by the protocol. How often this happens depends on the study or visit schedule. The principal investigator will explain the visit schedule to you during the informed consent process. Studies last for varying periods anything from 24 hours to four weeks and usually require overnight stays in our research facility.

                <p class="mt-3" data-zanim-xs='{"delay":0.1}'> <strong><u>Free Medical</u></strong>: At your pre-study medical visit you will meet one of our medical staff who will answer any questions you may have about the study, following which you will sign the consent form . You will be asked about your medical history and have certain procedures performed including urine and blood samples, blood pressure, height and weight, and ECG (Electrocardiogram a heart activity tracing). Each study is different, therefore you may also have additional tests performed or be required to attend for additional visits; details of which will be provided in your study information documents.

                <p class="mt-3" data-zanim-xs='{"delay":0.1}'>If you are a patient with a particular condition, you may participate in a trial to get early access to new treatments for your condition. Typically, trials for specific conditions are run by physician-investigators with advanced or specialised knowledge of the condition.

                <p class="mt-3" data-zanim-xs='{"delay":0.1}'><strong><u>Helping to develop medicines</u></strong>: Without the time and commitment of our volunteers, we would not be able to help research and develop new, potentially life saving medicines. Any medication you buy at the pharmacy today has been researched by clinical research companies like ICBio.

                <p class="mt-3" data-zanim-xs='{"delay":0.1}'> <strong><u>Recreational Time</u></strong>: When taking part in one of our studies you will have lots of time to relax with a book, chat with other volunteers, have access to a range of digital games and TV and can surf the Internet. You will be involved in certain study procedures each day but the rest of the time is yours.
